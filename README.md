<h1>Food Form</h1>

npm version: 7.19.1
node version: v16.6.0

To set up the project you have to download source files from github, by clicking code and then download zip, or from mail that I have send. Then go to "zadanie_rekrutacyjne" folder. As the last step write in comand line "npm install", and after that, "npm start".
Also it is able to see live preview of project on: <a href="https://zadanie-hexocean.web.app/">https://zadanie-hexocean.web.app/</a>

Time needed to complete the task was between 7 and 8 hours of work. Mostly because it was my first contact with Redux Form so I needed to get used to it.
